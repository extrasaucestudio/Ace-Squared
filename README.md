# Ace-Squared
Multiplayer FPS with voxels. (like minecraft with guns)
Unity implementation of a game called "Ace of Spades".
Coded by me except for some included libraries such as Newtonsoft JSON and Tom Weiland's basic client<->server code.

In project there is the client code and dedicated server code. This project was made with older version of Unity but if you know C# you should be able to setup it pretty quickly. There is some not clean code in the repository, I might clean it later.

The project supports using Ace of Spades voxel maps (version 1?)
